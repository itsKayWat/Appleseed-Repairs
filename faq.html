It is more likely that corrosion and residue deposits will begin to form on the logic board making the repair process more difficult. We recommend sending the device in as soon as possible."

For example, if your home button isn't functioning properly, the issue could be caused by the home button flex, the lower dock connector assembly, the logic board, or any combination since the phone was water damaged."
